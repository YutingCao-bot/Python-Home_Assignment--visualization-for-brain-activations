This project is a home assignment for the Programming for Psychologists course at VU. The purpose of this code is to visualize a brain image with a statistical overlay highlighting regions typically associated with social cognition. Additionally, the code generates a histogram of the values from the functional data file.

I used publicly available data from Neurosynth, a meta-analysis platform that synthesizes the results of thousands of fMRI studies. The specific datasets used are:(The links to the Neurosynth pages of social cognition: https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/social%20cognition/)/

Structural MRI data (referred to as anatomical data)/
Functional data (referred to as uniformity test results)/

The following Python packages were utilized in this notebook:/

nibabel/
nilearn/
